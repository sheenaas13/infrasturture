            <p>At InfraBuild, we take your privacy seriously. This policy outlines how we collect, use,
                and protect your personal information when you interact with our website or services. It also explains
                your rights regarding your data and how you can exercise them. We believe transparency is the
                cornerstone of trust, which is why we are open about our practices and your choices.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to safeguarding your data is rooted in respect for your trust. We want you to feel
                confident that your information is handled responsibly and ethically. From the moment data is collected
                to how it is stored and used, we apply principles of fairness, legality, and accountability to every
                step of our data handling process.</p>
            <p>Whether you are browsing our content or using our services more actively, we aim to make privacy a
                seamless and integral part of your experience. This policy should answer your key questions, and we’re
                always here to clarify any uncertainties. Please take a moment to read through the sections below
                carefully.</p>

            <h2 id="data">Data <span>Collection</span></h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> When you interact with us, such as by signing up
                    or contacting support, we collect your name, email, and any information you choose to share. This
                    also includes your communication preferences and account credentials if applicable.
                    <br><br>We take your voluntarily submitted data seriously, storing it securely and using it solely
                    for the purposes outlined. Your interactions with forms, surveys, or feedback areas fall under this
                    collection category.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We collect technical data such as IP address,
                    browser type, device identifiers, and browsing activity using cookies and analytics tools. This data
                    helps us analyze traffic patterns and tailor your experience.
                    <br><br>Additionally, we may track interaction with various elements of our platform, such as button
                    clicks or scroll depth, which informs our UI and accessibility improvements over time.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Sources:</strong> We may receive information from partners like ad networks or
                    social media platforms in accordance with their policies and your settings. These sources provide
                    enriched context for how users engage across platforms.
                    <br><br>Our agreements with third parties are designed to ensure that your data is handled with
                    equal or greater protection than we provide internally. We vet all external tools and integrations
                    carefully.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Data:</strong> We analyze user interactions to understand behavior patterns and
                    preferences, helping us refine and personalize our offerings.
                    <br><br>Behavioral insights also contribute to our fraud prevention protocols, enabling detection of
                    unusual patterns or anomalies before harm can occur.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Details:</strong> Any purchases or financial transactions made through our
                    platform may involve the collection of billing information and purchase history.
                    <br><br>This includes payment method, purchase date, invoice data, and refund information. We ensure
                    PCI-compliant handling of sensitive payment details and never store full credit card numbers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We gather data about the device you use, including operating
                    system, hardware model, and mobile network information.
                    <br><br>Understanding your device setup helps us tailor our performance, resolve bugs, and optimize
                    compatibility across operating systems and browser types.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We use analytic tools to measure user activity, track page visits,
                    and gather insights into engagement levels across our services.
                    <br><br>This enables us to continuously improve the relevance of content, identify popular features,
                    and detect any usability issues experienced by visitors.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="usage">Use of <span>Data</span></h2>
            <p>We use your data to provide and improve our services, communicate with you, fulfill legal obligations,

                usage.</p>

            <h2 id="rights">Your <span>Rights</span></h2>
            <p>You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data at any time. You may also
                object to certain processing activities or withdraw consent where applicable. We strive to make these
                requests easy to initiate and resolve promptly.</p>
            <p>Your privacy rights include the right to be informed about how your data is collected and used. You have
                the right to restrict processing, request data portability, and lodge a complaint with a data protection
                authority if needed. We honor all such requests in compliance with relevant privacy laws.</p>

                guide you. We take your concerns seriously and aim to resolve any privacy-related issues with care and
                attention.</p>

            <h2 id="security">Security <span>Measures</span></h2>
            <p>We implement industry-standard safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or
                misuse. This includes encryption, access controls, and regular monitoring. We invest in tools and
                processes to ensure that your data remains secure throughout its lifecycle.</p>
            <p>Security audits, intrusion detection systems, and staff training are part of our ongoing commitment to
                data security. We restrict access to your information only to those who require it and maintain clear
                protocols for handling any incidents or breaches.</p>
            <p>Despite our best efforts, no system is completely immune to risk. However, we continuously assess and
                enhance our measures to ensure we offer strong and reliable protection. If a data breach occurs, we
                follow strict procedures to notify affected users and mitigate any potential harm.</p>
